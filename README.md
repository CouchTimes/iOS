# CouchTimes

> ⚠️ This project is still WIP and not yet released in the App Store.

CouchTimes is a simple, fun & beautiful way to keep track of the shows you watch. While the app is fully open source, the intention is to bring it to the App Store as a paid app (unsure about the cost, but it will be < 5 $ one-time purchase).

With CouchTimes you can't only keep track of the shows you are currently watching. You can also see your whole history and your favorites. Finding good recommendations for your friends was never easier.

## Getting Started

1. Check out the latest version of the project: <br> `git clone https://github.com/CouchTimes/CouchTimes.git`
2. Open the `CouchTimes.xcodeproj` file
3. Build and run the CouchTimes.
